\usage{
lsmm(
  formula,
  instruments,
  data,
  subset,
  na.action,
  contrasts = NULL,
  t0 = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{formula specification(s) of the regression
relationship and the instruments. Either \code{instruments} is missing and
\code{formula} has three parts as in \code{y ~ x1 + x2 | z1 + z2 + z3}
(recommended) or \code{formula} is \code{y ~ x1 + x2} and \code{instruments}
is a one-sided formula \code{~ z1 + z2 + z3} (only for backward
compatibility).}

\item{instruments}{formula specification(s) of the regression
relationship and the instruments. Either \code{instruments} is missing and
\code{formula} has three parts as in \code{y ~ x1 + x2 | z1 + z2 + z3}
(recommended) or \code{formula} is \code{y ~ x1 + x2} and \code{instruments}
is a one-sided formula \code{~ z1 + z2 + z3} (only for backward
compatibility).}

\item{data}{an optional data frame containing the variables in the model.
By default the variables are taken from the environment of the
\code{formula}.}

\item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be
used in fitting the model.}

\item{na.action}{a function that indicates what should happen when the data
contain \code{NA}s. The default is set by the \code{na.action} option.}

\item{contrasts}{an optional list. See the \code{contrasts.arg} of
\code{\link[stats:model.matrix]{model.matrix.default}}.}

\item{t0}{A vector of starting values for the gmm optimizer. This should
have length equal to the number of exposures plus 1.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}

\description{
The logistic structural mean model (LSMM) is due to Robins (1989).
This command implements the double-LSMM due to Vansteelandt and
Goetghebeur (2003) using the GMM estimation approach of Clarke et al. (2015).
